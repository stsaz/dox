Falling To Hell
(Aug 2016)

[i]
One chance to live a life
But for eternity thrive.
Find God, give everything to your faith.
I was one of those
Who would never oppose,
I was, until I saw my own grave.

[brg]
No!
Did I have to go?
Demons pull below.
All I know I'm falling into darkness.

[r]
How can it be this way:
I'm not in heaven?
For all the time I prayed,
Lived by the right.
What did I do or say
To burn forever?
My soul is fading to the night,

Falling to hell,
To hell -
The eternal jail
In hell.

[ii]
I swore with my blood
Not to turn away from God,
Now I can't forgive his betrayal.
Used to believe in fate,
Now I only feel hate:
My body's dead, my soul's in jail.

[var]
The light is fading -
I'm all alone.
The fear's invading,
Inside it's grown.

Relentless horror
Of coming pain -
There's no tomorrow,
My life's in vain.
