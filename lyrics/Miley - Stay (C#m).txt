Miley Cyrus - Stay (C#m)

[i]
            C#m
Well, it's good to hear your voice
   F#m
I hope you're doing fine
    B                   G#7
And if you ever wonder,
     A              E
I'm lonely here at night
     C#m
I'm lost here in this moment
     F#m
And time keeps slipping by
    B                         G#7
And if I could have just one wish
     A              E
I'd have you by my side

[brg]
E   F#m    B
Oh, oh I miss you
E   F#m    B
Oh, oh I need you

[r]
                C#m                A
And I love you more than I did before
          E                    B
And if today I don't see your face
            C#m                            A
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
         E           B
It gets harder everyday

Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me I will stay
   A
I will stay

[ii]
Well, I try to live without you
Tears fall from my eyes
I'm alone and I feel empty
God, I'm torn apart inside

I look up at the stars
Hoping you're doing the same
And somehow I feel closer
And I can hear you say

[brg]

[r]

[var]
         A       E
I will stay, always stay
   F#m
I never wanna lose you
          B                     G#7
And if I had to I would choose you
 A                 E
So stay, please always stay
           F#m
You're the one that I hold onto
           B                     G#7 A
'Cause my heart would stop without you

[r]

[r]
I will stay
I'll always stay

And I love you more than I did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
                                  A
And if you ask I will stay, I will stay
B        C#m
I will stay
