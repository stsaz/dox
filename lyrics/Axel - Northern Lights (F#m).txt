[i]
F#m             E               F#m  A E
Rain's falling down from the horizon
We travel all across the seas
The vast expanse of the ocean
The sirens call under a plea

[brg]
Bm              F#m     Bm         F#m
We're sailing in circles, almost blind
Bm             F#m           E
We are at the point of no return

F#m           E               F#m  A E
The northern lights keep on shining
           E            D
Over the ocean and the sea
The northern lights shine on forever
The guiding light for you and me, you and me

[ii]
From far away we saw the rainbow
Shimmering brightly across the land
We called the rulers of Atlantis
Leading us through the world's dead end

...for you and me
