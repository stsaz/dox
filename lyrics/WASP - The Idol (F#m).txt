W.A.S.P. - The Idol

[intro]
F#m                           E
Will I be alone this morning, will I need my friends?
D                                E
Something just to ease away the pain
Now I never see the loneliness behind my face
I am just a prisoner to my faith

[i]
F#m                                      E
If I could only stand and stare in the mirror would I see
Bm                      F#m
One fallen hero with a face like me
And if I scream, could anybody hear me, oh?
If I smash the silence, you'll see what fame has done to me

[brg]
D              E                 F#m
Kiss away the pain and leave me lonely
And I'll never know if love's a lie
Oh, being crazy in paradise is easy
D                E             D     E
Do you see the prisoners in my eyes?

[r]
              F#m             E
Where is the love to shelter me?
         D     E
Give me love, love set me free
Where is the love, to shelter me?
      D     E                         F#m
Only love, love set me free, set me free
