F#m                C#m
Open your heart to all of those years
 D                       A
Baby you look through a rainbow of tears.
You watched your dreams all fadin' away
This time you're right oh you make my day.

           C#m
Years may come
           F#m
Years may go
         D                          E
I still love you and I want you to know:

                  A
Some hearts are diamonds
                  D
Some hearts are stone
                  Bm              E
Some days you're tired of being alone.
Some hearts are diamonds
Some hearts are stone
It takes two lovers to be as one.

[ii]
Illusions of love They'll come and they'll go
Trust in your heart Maybe your love will grow.
Your silent tears they're so full of pride
Baby I know that you can't run and hide.

[brg]
You need love like I do
I hope you want me like I know I want you.

Some hearts are diamonds
