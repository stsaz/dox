Miley Cyrus - I'll Always Remeber You (G#->A)

[i]
A
I always knew this day would come
F#m
We'd be standing one by one
Bm
With our future in our hands
D
So many dreams so many plans

Always knew after all these years
There'd be laughter there'd be tears
But never thought that I'd walk away
With so much joy but so much pain

[brg]
    Dsus2
And it's so hard to say goodbye

[r]
     A
But yesterday's gone
          F#m
We gotta keep moving on
         D
I'm so thankful for the moments
     E
So glad I got to know you

The times that we had
I'll keep like a photograph
And hold you in my heart forever
     Dsus2
I'll always remember you

A
Na-na-na-na
F#m
Na-na-na-na
E
Na-na-na-na
D
Na

[ii]
Another chapter in the book
Can't go back but you can look
And there we are on every page
Memories I'll always save

Up ahead on the open doors
Who knows what were heading towards?
I wish you love I wish you luck
For you the world just opens up

[brg]
But it's so hard to say goodbye

[r]

[var]
      F#m
Everyday that we had all the good all the bad
      A
I'll keep them here inside
         Bm
All the times that we shared every place everywhere
D                   E
You touched my life
          F#m
Yeah one day we'll look back we'll smile and we'll laugh
     A
But right now we just cry
E
Cause it's so hard to say goodbye

[r]

I'll always remember you
I'll always remember you
