MSG - Nightmare (C#m)

[i]
C#m                   C#m/A
Nightmare's lying here in the dark
Ooh scared like my dreams made their mark
   F#m  G#7
I wonder
Dreamer always alone
Lost in a part of myself I can't find anymore
I wonder if it's gonna end tonight

[brg]
C#m                     F#m
I can't sleep alone anymore
   B                  C#m
I need you here with me
Even though I closed all the doors
         B                 E
There's somethin' holdin' me

      B               F#m
Never ending nightmare
         A       B       C#m
Always there instead of you
Never ending nightmare
No escape this time from you

Lately been around someone new
Needed to fill in the space that once sheltered you
Still I worry, if you're gonna be alright

[brg]
I can't sleep alone anymore
Need someone here with me
All I ever wanted and more
My dreams are fighting for

[r]
Never ending nightmare
Always there instead of you
Never ending nightmare
Punishing me for the things I do
Never ending nightmare
No escape this time from you
