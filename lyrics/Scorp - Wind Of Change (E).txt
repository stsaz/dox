Scorpions - Wind Of Change (E)

[i]
E                 B
I follow the Moskva
               C#m
Down to Gorky Park
                  F#m       E B
Listening to the wind of change

An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

[ii]
The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers

The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

[r]
 E    B
Take me
        F#m           B
To the magic of the moment
       E    B
On a glory night
            F#m           B
Where the children of tomorrow
        C#m E
Dream away
                 B
In the wind of change

[iii]
Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever

I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

[r]
Take me
To the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow
Share their dreams
With you and me

Take me
To the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow
Dream away
In the wind of change

[var]
C#m                          B
The wind of change blows straight
                   C#m
Into the face of time
                            B
Like a stormwind that will ring
                               E
The freedom bell for peace of mind
                    F#m
Let your balalaika sing
                         G#7
What my guitar wants to say
