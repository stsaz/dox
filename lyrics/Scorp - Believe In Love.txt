Bm A A Bm G D A

[i]
Bm           F#
How does it feel babe
A                D
To play sweet revenge
G       D              F#7
Do you want me on my knees
How does it feel babe
To let me feel your strength
Don't be cruel, can't you see

[brg]
G                      A
If you don't catch me now
I can't stop falling down
     Bm                       A              Bm
Just one more night and the devil's got my soul
             G               A           Bm
I need your love babe don't treat me this way
Ooh I miss you, I miss you

[r]
 D        A                  Bm
Baby our love's got what it takes
    G                 A         D   G      A
To give us one more chance to start once again
Baby our love will find a way
As long as we believe in love

[ii]
How does it feel babe
To play destiny
I swear I'm not gonna crawl oh no
How does it feel babe
To make a fool out of me
How can you be so cold
be so cold

[brg]
If you don't catch me now
I can't stop falling down
Just one more night and the devil's got my soul
I need your love babe don't leave me this way
Ooh I miss you, I miss you

[r]
[r]
As long as we believe in love
