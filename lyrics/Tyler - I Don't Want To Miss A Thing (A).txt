Steve Tyler - I Don't Want To Miss A Thing

[i]
          A         E                 F#m
I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
            D                   C#m
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
              Bm
While you're far away and dreaming
          A           E                 F#m
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
          D                C#m      Bm
I could stay lost in this moment forever
               C#m       D                  E
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

A             E          Bm
Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
            D
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
                   E        A
And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

[ii]
Lying close to you feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming,
Wondering if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just wanna stay with you
In this moment forever, forever and ever

               G
I don't wanna miss one smile
               D
I don't wanna miss one kiss
              F
I just wanna be with you
                      C
Right here with you, just like this

              G
I just wanna hold you close
                       D
I feel your heart so close to mine
           Am               D
And just stay here in this moment
 C       E
For the rest of time, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep, yeah
I don't wanna miss a thing
I don't wanna miss a thing
