Miley Cyrus - When I Look At You (D#m)

[i]
D#m            F#
Everybody needs inspiration
C#         B
Everybody needs a song
A beautiful melody
When the night's so long
A#m                 B
'Cause there is no guarantee
F#              C#
That this life is easy

[r]
           F#           C#
Yeah, when my world is falling apart
              D#m          B
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves are flooding the shore
And I can't find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

[ii]
When I look at you, I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars hold the moon
Right there where they belong
And I know I'm not alone

[r]

[var]
F#     B    C#           D#m
You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kaleidoscope colors that
C#        B
Cover me, all I need
C#            D#m
Every breath that I breathe
F#            B         C#
Don't you know you're beautiful?

[r]
...
...Yeah, yeah, yeah
When the waves are flooding the shore
And I can't find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you
I look at you
Yeah, yeah, oh

[outro]
     F#    B    C#           B
And you appear just like a dream to me
